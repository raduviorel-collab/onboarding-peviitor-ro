Starting with 2016 I had my first project manager work experience and since then I have continuously search to improve my abilities to help the project team exceed stakeholders expectations. 
In this challenging journey, I have practiced the Waterfall, Agile/Scrum, Kanban and Lean frameworks, developing an affinity for transparent , measurable and efficient processes in an organization. 
My professional awarness is still improving day by day as I get more and more familiar with the best practices in the IT project management industry like devops, extreme programming, design thinking, 
from project to product flow principles, facilitation techinques for participatory decision making, flow metrics, collecting BI insights and the list is always opened.

I have experience as a Business Analyst, IT Project Manager and Scrum Master for digitalization projects, software development, platform upgrades and applications implementation. 

Lets Sprint!
